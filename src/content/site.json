      "id": "deterministic-first",
      "claim": "Deterministic before probabilistic",
      "explainer": "AI introduces variance into systems. Before adding that variance, I exhaust deterministic options—rules, lookups, structured logic. AI solves the residual ambiguity, not the whole problem. This makes systems debuggable and auditable."

      "id": "governance-before-scale",
      "claim": "Governance before scale",
      "explainer": "Scaling ungoverned AI creates compounding risk. I design validation layers, ownership boundaries, and audit trails before expanding scope. The cost of retrofitting governance is always higher than building it in."
    },
    {
      "id": "failure-modes",
      "claim": "Design for failure modes, not happy paths",
      "explainer": "Happy paths are easy. I focus on what happens when inputs are malformed, when models hallucinate, when upstream data is late. Systems that handle failure gracefully earn trust; systems that assume success break it."
    },
    {
      "id": "human-checkpoints",
      "claim": "Human checkpoints by default",
      "explainer": "Automation without oversight becomes a liability. I build systems where humans review before consequential actions, not after failures. 'The AI said so' is never an acceptable answer to a regulator or executive."

    {
      "id": "end-to-end-ownership",
      "claim": "End-to-end system ownership",
      "explainer": "Handoffs create gaps where failures hide. I own systems from data ingestion through decision outputs—understanding the full chain means catching problems before they compound downstream."

    {
      "id": "validation-auditability",
      "claim": "Validation and auditability as requirements",
      "explainer": "If a system cannot explain its outputs or prove its inputs were valid, it should not run in production. I treat validation and audit trails as first-class requirements, not afterthoughts."
